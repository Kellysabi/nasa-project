1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-mission-control.git
    cd nasa-mission-control
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
